The measurements are conducted in two scenarios with area of the anchors are at 20x20 and 20x40 meters
Note: the Z-direction is just the high of the tri-pot, where the TREK1000 is placed on top of this.

The 1st anchors set-up is done as follows:

A0 (0, 0, 1.2)     
A1 (20, 0, 1.2)
A2 (20, 20, 1.2)
A3 (0, 20, 1.2)

The 2nd anchors' set-up is done as follows:
A0 (0, 0, 1.2)
A1 (20, 0, 1.2)
A2 (20, 40, 1.2)
A3 (0, 40, 1.2)

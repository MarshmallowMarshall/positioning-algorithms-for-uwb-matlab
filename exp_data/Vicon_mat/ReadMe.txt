The experimental evaluation between the Vicon Camera System and UWB system

The experiments were conducted in TWB laboratory (6 m × 6 m × 3.7) environments at different scenarios.
The file naming convention for the Vicon Camera System was as follows:

1. 4vnm		: stands for "Measurement data from 4 anchors, in which the antenna of TAG was in a vertical position and it's not moving (stationary point)
2. 4vbA0  	: 4 anchors, Tag's antenna is vertical position, Anchor ID0 is blocked by human at 1 meter away from the TAG.
3. 4vbA1  	: Anchor ID1 is blocked.
4. 4vbA2s 	: Anchor ID2 is blocked. "s" stands for the measurement is conducted second time because of error or insufficient data occurred in the 1st.
5. 4vbA3s 	: Anchor ID 3 is blocked.
6. m1L     	: moving tag with the shape of Looping
7. m2R		: moving tag with the shape of Ring 
8. m3S		: Moving tag with the shape of S
9. 4Vnm2	: not moving (stationary) measurement at location 2

The current set-up (coplanar plane) in TWR doesn't support the 3D scenario for Multilateration approach.
Therefore, the Z-values in 3D for "Multilateral" methods are zeros in the evaluation.
